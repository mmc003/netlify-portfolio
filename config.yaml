    content: |-
      Hi! I’m Michael Chu, a 21-year-old software engineer based in the Bay Area, previously a Software Development Intern at FarmX.
      
      I am currently studying Cognitive Science with a specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation at the University of California, San Diego. Last year I also picked up a minor in Computer Science. I previously studied Computer Engineering at UC Santa Cruz.

      I’m passionate about building innovative solutions that leverage AI and machine learning to solve real-world problems. My interests lie in robotics, scalable backend development, and computer vision. I specialize in Python and C++, with hands-on experience in ROS2, PyTorch, and CUDA for high-performance applications.

      Outside of tech, I’m also a street photographer and aspiring event photographer, capturing candid moments and dynamic scenes that tell compelling stories through the lens.
